Coupon fraud is one of the biggest problems in a business world. Our problem is related
to discount coupon tampering in a retail chain. In this, a manufacturer distributes their product to
the retailers where they provide discounts to the products. All the retailers get access to the
discount coupons of the products and this is shared to the customers. Customers can redeem the
discounts of the product and buy them in low cost. Our aim is to solve the tampering in these
coupons so that the manufacturers do not face loss. We use blockchain to solve this problem. The
immutability and transparency in blockchain help us to do this. We generate the coupons as e-
coupons(QR-code) into blockchain network as a hash of the product details including the
timestamp. Once we do this no one can change them due to the immutability feature provided by the blockchain also everyone in the
chain can view the sales made. It also enables the B2B and B2C in the e-commerce.
