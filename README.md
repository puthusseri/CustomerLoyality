# CustomerLoyality

## Introduction

This project was to solve a problem that exist in the current market. The consumer market have many issues. We mainly focus on
solving the problem with discount coupen manipulations. The discount coupens can be easily manipulated if the system was stored
and executed in a centralized environment. A professional hacker can easily break though the system and can manipulate the data.


## Our solution

We switch the system into a decentralized environment. The discount coupens are stored in a blockchian, so that the data will
be tamper proof.
